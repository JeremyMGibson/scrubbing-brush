# Chia Data Integrity Management
Automated data integrity dashboard for reporting and cleaning data

With Chia you can create a series of data integrity measures that will run SQL checks on a nightly basis. Get easy reports on the number of errors, both new and recurring, and details of any resolutions to existing errors that have been made.

Manually mark errors to ignore if for those cases you have checked and get long term history of your progress.

Give simple transparency to the quality of your data.
